<h6>1.Google tracks you</h6>
<p>With Go!, you know nothing about yourself. Your privacy is important to us and we take it seriously. Unlike Google, they know your ip address, personal information, your activities and even your search history. This is information that helps google to offer you search results, advertisements, research proposals according to their activities. Let's take the example that you are visiting a site about make-up. Of course, you may have ads powered by AdSense, a service by Google. AdSense will collect certain information from you and use it to serve you ads relevant to your business. So you might have advertisements for make-up. As you have searched for a makeup site on google, when you type another search, they will also surely offer you searches via your previous search. Google can also sell your information to another company to do the same thing most of the time.</p>

<h6>2.Google have ads on your searches</h6>
<p>Like most search engines, it has ads. Even some that go with your information and your research (another tracking story). The search engine offers you advertising that you may not like, not report and many other reasons. You even advertise with unwanted, inappropriate and even dangerous links, but it happens sometimes. With Go!, 0 ads in your searches are placed.</p>

<h6>3.Incognito mode in Google Chrome isn't private</h6>
<p>Private browsing mode on Chrome does not guarantee a completely private browsing experience as your IP address and history may be visible to your ISP, employer, or the websites themselves. It's important to take other steps to protect your privacy online. While Firefox and Brave, it offers a better ingonito mode even more private</p>

<h6>In conclusion...</h6>
<p>from Google to Go! Search, a private search engine, can provide better online privacy protection by avoiding personal data collection and browsing monitoring. It may also be beneficial to switch from Google Chrome to another browser that offers more robust privacy options and better protection against online trackers. By taking these steps, it is possible to significantly reduce online exposure and maintain privacy.</p>
